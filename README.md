# Employee-Management-
This is java project build for management of employees.
For backend we have used mysql server.

The first window of this app is called 'Start_page', which has two respective buttons for employee and manager/admin login in botton right corner.
This program tries to provide hierarchical view of the organization to user(admin in perticular), by loggin in user is introduced with different departments of company
and in those different department user can see different projects the employees are working on.

By admin login user can manage all kind of employee data, such as 

1)Adding new employee to the company.
2)Removing an employee.
3)Accept/Reject employees leave applications.
4)Updating an employee details.
5)Admin can also search for perticular employee details using unique ID alloted to employee.

By emplyee login user can apply for leave, by filling up all the required details. 
after he has applied for leave admin will have the previlage to either accepte or reject the leave.

Through employee login user can also check if his leave is accepted or not.
